The players arrive at the Eye of Abendego, and the following events are foreshadowed by the presence of [Voidworms](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=3144) being as cute as ever.

While the way is short it is also treacherous enough for the way to the eye of the storm to be [[Travel (3)]]. Halfway through the players can see an explosion of alien colors inside the eye, and a silhouette of a gigantic floating ring. The ring happens to be an [Ouroboros](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1256) summoned by a group of [[Proteans]] convinced that the [[Eternal Summer]] begins a prophecy of the end of the natural order and the return to primordial soup.

**Do not try to fight the [[Ouroboros. DEATH 12]]. It is a terrain hazard. It WILL kill you.**
