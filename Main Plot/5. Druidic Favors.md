The players want to get to [[The First World]]. To do that they plan to get involved in a seasonal ceremony held by the [[Wormwood Druids]] meant to help the passing of fey to help create a stable seasonal cycle. Unfortunately the Druids are threatened by the possibility of the newly created [[Kingdom of Houlum]] expanding into the ritual site grounds. [[Mila the Druid]] asks the players to help gather allies to defend the grounds from the encroaching mobs of lumberjacks and prison laborers.
The players are asked to 
- [[Travel (1)]] inside enemy territory to talk with [[Jenny the Huldra]] 
- [[Travel (1)]] into the woods to [[Master Veloth]].
