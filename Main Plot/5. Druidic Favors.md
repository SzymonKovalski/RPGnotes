The [[Players]] want to get to [[The First World]]. To do that they plan to get involved in a seasonal ceremony held by the [[Wormwood Druids]] meant to help the passing of fey to help create a stable seasonal cycle. Unfortunately the Druids are threatened by the possibility of the newly created [[Kingdom of Houlum]] expanding into the ritual site grounds. [[Mila the Druid]] asks the [[Players]] to help gather allies to defend the grounds from the encroaching mobs of lumberjacks and prison laborers.
The [[Players]] are asked to [[Travel (Short)]] inside enemy territory to talk with [[Jenny the Huldra]] and [[Bok the Ovinnik]].
