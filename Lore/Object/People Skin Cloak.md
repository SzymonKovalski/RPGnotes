Rare, Invested, Magical 
	Much like dragon scale armor, this item is designed to protect against a specific group of creatures - humanoids and other sapiens to be exact.
	A People Skin Cloak can effect two common ancestries, decided at the time of creation. Any common ancestry can be traded for two uncommon ancestries or all rare ancestries. Versatile heritages such as aiuvarin count as both the original ancestry and elf. Adopted ancestry makes someone count as both their original ancestry and the ancestry they adopted.
