Male [Young Linnorm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1726) doomed to become a [Tarn Linnorm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=3085&Redirected=1) by having his head and neck bifurcated. He will encounter something scary, that thing will split his head in two thinking it killed him, but he will slip away and somehow survive with his brain literally separated in two.

He knows some minor things about what Fafnheir shared with the [[Linnorms]]
