Female (she/they) Psionic [Kobold](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=435) [Vampire](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=480&Redirected=1) child with a large scar on her lower jaw, which she got from hanging on an iron meathook entombed inside the [Spire of Destiny](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Spire_of_Destiny). They are prophesized to bring forth an age of darkness. She does NOT want to be involved in the [[Prophecy of the Bleeding Sun]], she just wants her revenge against the father of [God-King Walkena](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Walkena) (sins of the father style), which happens to go along with the prophecy.

Rune may seem like a good traveling companion considering if she reaches the First World the prophecy would be severed, but they are severely allergic to the sun, making them unable to travel during the day and require a source of fresh blood.

Rune does not like feeding on people and avoids it until the last possible moment before becoming bloodstarved, which is a state she prioritizes npcs and feeding makes her kill the victim, though if coerced into feeding on a player character she causes a permanent [Drained 2](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) in addition to normal effects instead of killing them. If rune feeds in her normal state she causes the victim to become [Fatigued](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=73)until she feeds again or dies.
