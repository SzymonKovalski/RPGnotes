Male [Adult Mirage Dragon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=2951), whose title is given to him by [[Kavozein, Earthen Mind]] as a play on the insult "Hollow Head"

Erarth is a close childhood friend of [[Kavozein, Earthen Mind|Kavozein]]. He despises noise and lives separate from everyone in a lair hidden and defended with an obnoxious amount of illusions. Erarth has a [Greater Wildwood Ink](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2224) he got from [[Kavozein, Earthen Mind|Kavozein]] (which he is not stuck with, he in fact has to recycle it every shed).
