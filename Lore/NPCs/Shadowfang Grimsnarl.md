Genderless [Somnalu](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1737) created out of [[Zoraya]]s nightmares when she was a hatchling seeing a human hero celebrating their achievement while wearing dragonhide armor. Born from her other fear it is determined to protect her at all cost. It was a bodyguard while she was a hatchling and youth, but realized it was falling behind so it chose to sever itself from her in order to grow strong enough to protect her from anything in the world.

If presented with the [[Chewtoy Doll]] he asks telepathically "You have something of hers. Are you friend ... or foe?" and believes what the player answers.
