![[Fafnheir.png]]
One of the original prototypes for what a dragon could be from [[The First World]], who has bitten off the paw of his creator-god [[Dahak]] and been abandoned ever since. Unknown to him [[Dahak]] is shattered.
Fafnheir chooses to keep the form of a [[Linnorms|Linnorm]] over that of a standard dragon as he relates to them more due to their closeness to [[The First World]]

If attacked [[20. EXTREME. Fafnheir.]]
