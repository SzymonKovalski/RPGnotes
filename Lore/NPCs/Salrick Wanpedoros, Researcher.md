Male [Anadi Sage](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1423) obsessed with history. 

He has a phobia of undead. Whenever he is in proximity of an undead he is aware of he has to make a DC 26 Will save (this is an incapacitation effect. so a success vs a lvl 5 undead is a failure).

- Success: frightened 3.
- Failure: frightened 3 that cant be reduced until Salrick is no longer aware of any undead in the area.
- Critical Failure: As failure and fleeing while frightened.
