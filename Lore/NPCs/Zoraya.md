Wearer of a [[People Skin Cloak|Greater People Skin Cloak (Human)]]. Is a leader of [[the Oni]]
Zoraya was traumatized as a hatchling by humans celebrating a hero wearing dragonhide armor, and from her nightmares she spawned [[Shadowfang Grimsnarl]] as a not-so imaginary friend. Since then she has become numb and cold to everyone, keeping her Oni underlings in line with fear. Telling her Shadowfang is still alive comforts her and improves her view of the players.
