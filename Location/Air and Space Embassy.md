#Location
A place in [[Aral, The Spire]] for air elementals to conduct diplomatic relations on the Plane of Wood. Also the most survivable shelter for lost planar travelers. The building itself seems entirely empty beyond the odd gust of wind but it is inhabited by no less than 3 invisible stalkers and 4 air elementals. None of them like to speak.

If the residents are displeased [[Air and Space Embassy. Extreme 7]]
