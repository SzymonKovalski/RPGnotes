A saga is a series of connected [[stories]], centered around a single covenant. In some cases the only connection between two stories is that both happen to people who live at the covenant, and not even the same people. Other stories are linked into a longer narrative, with a major climax. This chapter provides guidance on how to run a good saga.

# Background Questions
While products from Atlas Games provide a wealth of detail about the background of Ars Magica, there are always areas which are open to interpretation by individual troupes. In many cases these are matters that can simply be ignored when writing books, but in others it is more a question of how you use a book in your sagas. This section looks at a few of the more significant choices you need to consider when deciding how Ars Magica works for your troupe.

# Saga Speed
Advancement in Ars Magica happens by seasons of game time (see “Advancement,” page 163), and so the number of seasons of game time that pass for every game session is an extremely important factor in determining the style of a saga. The ideal saga speed is entirely a matter of troupe preference, but it is important to be aware of the implications in advance. Fortunately it is easy to speed up or slow down a saga if you decide that you have made a mistake.

# Troupe Style Roleplaying
In a typical roleplaying game one person serves as the gamemaster, while the other participants have one character each, whom they play from session to session. Troupe-style roleplaying breaks away from those assumptions, and this can make it difficult for experienced roleplayers to get into. There are a number of types of troupe-style play, and while they are listed in ascending order of difference from standard roleplaying, this is not meant to suggest that the later forms are better than the earlier. If you want to try the full range, it is probably best to work up through the stages, so that people get used to the differing roles of troupe-style games, but you can also pick a single stage that sits well with your group and simply use that. 
If Ars Magica is your first roleplaying game, you should simply select the style that seems most appealing, and then modify it as necessary so that everyone is having fun. 
Although none of the styles of troupe style play are better for everyone, it is almost always better to use some version of troupe style play rather than conventional play. This is because, although the game is centered on magi, it is very hard to run a whole saga in which the players play their magi in every session. For one thing, it becomes very difficult to challenge a whole group of fairly experienced magi, as at least one member of the group is likely to be skilled at any form of magic. It can be done, but having to do it every session is likely to strain the storyguide. Another problem is that magi like to spend time in their laboratories, and they might well not want to go out at the same time. After a while, it can come to seem rather artificial if everyone drops everything to go on an adventure.
However, if you play in the conventional fashion and some players have non-magi, different problems arise. First, magi are far more powerful than other characters, and get far more attention in the rules. Someone stuck playing a knight might well find his character aging and dying, possibly of boredom, while the magi study magic and create enchanted devices, and even when he does get to see some action he is likely to be overshadowed by the magi in most adventures.
Even the simplest troupe-style play avoids these problems, as every player has a magus and another character. Thus, you should at least try it out.

# Saga Styles
There are a number of different ways of playing Ars Magica, all valid, and many compatible with each other. Indeed, almost any combination is possible over the course of a saga, particularly as there is nothing wrong with the style of a saga changing over time. The descriptions here are merely intended to give you some ideas, and help you work out what sort of saga you want to play.
