You can set your saga in a pure fantasy world. You might adapt a published one to include the Order of Hermes, or create your own. The advantage is that you donâ€™t have to worry about historical facts at all, and can have exactly the setting you want. The disadvantage is that the setting of Ars Magica has even influenced the mechanics, so you will find that you have to adapt or ignore a lot of the game material
