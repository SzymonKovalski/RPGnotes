A companion is an important non-magus. Like magi, player character companions belong to a single player, who controls that character’s decisions. Beyond this, companions have little in common with one another. One might be a knight and veteran of the Crusades, another might be a wandering friar, a third an un Gifted Redcap, still another a noblewoman. Because the Order of Hermes stands somewhat outside medieval society, it tends to attract those who do not fit in, so a companion could also be a woman who wants to serve as a knight, a priest who sees supernatural visions and has tipped into heresy, or a werewolf seeking someone who might be able to cure her affliction.
Although each player has a magus and a companion, they are almost never played together, and thus should not be linked to each other. Linking your companion to another player’s magus is a good idea, though, as that provides two player characters with a reason to investigate things together. If you do link your companion to another player’s magus, your companion should have abilities that complement those of the magus, rather than overlapping.
Companions should generally not have The Gift, unless you intend them to become magi at some point.
