A magus is a powerful wizard, even when he has only just finished his training. Magi rule the covenant around which a saga revolves, and have the potential to become as powerful as any human being can. A magus player character belongs to a single player, who has complete control over that characterâ€™s decisions.
Although magi are very powerful, they are also limited in important ways by The Gift, their ability to work magic (see pages 36 and 75). This means that there are some things that only non-magi can do effectively. In addition, magi are rarely skilled at anything other than magic, which means that they need help in everyday affairs
