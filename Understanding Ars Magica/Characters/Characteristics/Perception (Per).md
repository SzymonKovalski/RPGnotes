Perception quantifies the ability to notice things, as well as powers of intuition. While sometimes conscious, Perception often works intuitively â€” your character simply notices something. The storyguide may also let you roll Perception when checking various Knowledges, to see if you have insight into a certain fact or concept. Perception is important for Abilities such as Awareness, Hunt, and Folk Ken.
