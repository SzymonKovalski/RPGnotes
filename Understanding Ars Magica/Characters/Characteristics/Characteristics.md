There are eight Characteristics in Ars Magica, each representing one of a given character’s inborn attributes. Each Characteristic has a score that describes the degree of the character’s aptitude. A score of 0 is completely average, therefore positive numbers denote higher-than-average ability and negative numbers below-average ability. All but the most exceptional of individuals have Characteristics that fall between –3 and +3.
Since Characteristics represent your character’s inborn potential, they cannot be increased by normal means. In rare circumstances, the storyguide may decide that drastic events warrant some sort of permanent change to a Characteristic, and powerful magic can also raise them, but for most characters, they are fixed
