Abilities are a characterâ€™s learned skills. They usually do increase during the course of a saga. Characters in Ars Magica can choose from a wide range of Abilities, listed in the Abilities chapter on page 63, which are divided into five types: General Abilities, which can be learned by anyone, and Academic Abilities, Arcane Abilities, Martial Abilities, and Supernatural Abilities. A character can only learn Academic, Arcane, or Martial Abilities if he has an appropriate Virtue or Flaw, or is a magus. 
A character cannot learn or use a Supernatural Ability at all unless he has the Virtue granting it, or has The Gift and has learned that Ability.
