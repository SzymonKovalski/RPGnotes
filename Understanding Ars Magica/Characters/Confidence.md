Important characters have a Confidence Score and Confidence Points. This includes both central player characters (magi and companions) and important NPCs, such as recurring antagonists and allies. These characters start with three Confidence Points. Most such characters start with a Confidence Score of one, but this can be modified by Virtues and Flaws. There is no limit to the number of Confidence Points that a character can have.
# USING CONFIDENCE
A player may spend Confidence Points on most rolls to get +3 to the total per point spent. He may decide to spend the point after the dice are rolled and the putative result of the action is known. He may not spend Confidence on a roll that botched, but he may spend it on a roll of zero which was not a botch. A player may spend any number of points up to, but not exceeding, the character’s Confidence Score.
Once a Confidence Point is spent, it is gone forever. Confidence Points are not recovered. 
Confidence may not be spent on rolls which represent a whole season’s activities, such as rolls for studying from vis.

# GETTING NEW CONFIDENCE POINTS
The storyguide for a session hands out Confidence Points to characters at the end of the session. To qualify for Confidence Points, the character must have been played for a significant length of time during that session, and must have made a contribution to the session.
Characters should be awarded one Confidence Point for each of the following that they managed:
• Achieve a personal goal.
• Contribute to achievement of a group goal, even if it wasn’t a personal goal. 
• Success in a difficult task. (Only one award per character per session.)
• Entertainingly well roleplayed. This means that the player portrayed the character well, and in a way that entertained and enhanced the fun of the other players.
• Bonus. This point is awarded if the storyguide thinks that the character or player did something that deserves a reward, but which does not fall under the above categories. You should only award one bonus point per character per session. Typical characters should gain two or three Confidence Points per session.

# RAISING CONFIDENCE SCORE
A character’s Confidence Score can only be increased by long-term story events which greatly increase the character’s self-confidence and self-reliance. As a baseline, the fifteen gruelling years of a Tytalus apprenticeship are enough to raise a character’s Confidence Score by one point. Raises in play should follow on events of a similar magnitude and duration
