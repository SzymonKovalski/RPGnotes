Reactive stories are a good way to start a saga, because it gives the players something immediate to do. They also serve to remind the players that their characters are not aware of everything going on in the world before it happens. They work well with young magi, but become harder to create as the magi get older. This is because, with a reactive story, the magi are only interested in resolving the problem, and thus will use the most efficient means available. In general, they do not care how the problem gets resolved. Thus, elder magi might solve a political campaign against the covenant through the liberal use of Mentem spells. This is unlikely to provide the hours of entertaining political play that the storyguide was after. Investigative stories are quickly short-circuited by Intellego magic, and enemies that a powerful magus cannot simply despatch are too powerful to be common.
Once the magi are very powerful, it is possible to run reactive stories for just the companions and grogs. Give them a reason not to disturb the magi, and then let them sort the problem out by themselves. It is possible to make the stories very challenging for the mundane characters, because if everything goes horribly wrong the playersâ€™ other characters can charge in to save the day, which is much more satisfying for the players than having non-player characters do it
