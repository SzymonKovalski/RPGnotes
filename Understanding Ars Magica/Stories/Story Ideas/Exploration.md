The characters go somewhere they haven’t been before, and find out about it. This covers going into caves, killing monsters, and taking their stuff, but it is much broader. It also includes traveling to the local abbey and trying to set up good relations with the abbot, finding a faerie forest and learning how to collect raw vis there, and even visiting other covenants of the Order for the first time.
Exploration stories are a very good way to start a saga, as the characters and players will both want to know more about the area around their covenant. In addition, once they have been introduced to an area you can use that place to generate more stories

# Places to Explore
• The Covenant. If the covenant was there before the player characters joined, they may not know everything about it.
• Mundane Villages. The villages nearest the covenant will become aware of
its existence, so it is a good idea if the magi know a bit about them. Friendly
relations would be ideal, of course.
• Mundane Towns. The magi are likely to need supplies which have to be
bought in a town, so they should explore the local towns. This might be
best done by sending the grogs, with maybe a companion.
• Other Covenants. Magi are expected to give hospitality to visiting magi,
even if they turn up uninvited. Getting to know your neighbors is a good
idea, provided you can avoid upsetting them.
• A faerie forest where the intelligent creatures have the shape of animals,
and the dumb brutes have the shape of humans.
• A faerie palace where a shining queen grants rewards to those who bring the
most beautiful stories. The stories become jewels or fine tapestries when
told, and it is possible to learn much from the queen’s stored treasures.
• A faerie village that looks a lot like a mundane village, except that the
wheat is literally golden and the fruit trees bear gems. Attempting to eat the
food is not recommended.
• A set of ancient standing stones that form a magical regiob. In higher levels
the stones are aware and intelligent, being the forms of ancient elementals.
• An abandoned village, depopulated by an infernal plague and now the
home of demons and undead.
• A lake that covers both a magical region and a faerie region. If characters
enter the magical region, they find many talking fish, which live in an
elaborate society. In the faerie region they find beautiful people living
underwater, in a castle built of shells
