Magi are not immune to the lure of treasure hunting, particularly the lure of raw vis. For a covenant, the greatest treasure is a vis source, which reliably provides a certain number of pawns of vis every year. Mundane treasure also has some appeal, but most covenants are rich anyway, and magi with vis can make mundane riches fairly easily. Books are an exception, as useful ones cannot be magically created. Enchanted devices tempt magi almost as much as vis, and in some cases the search for an Arcane Connection to a powerful enemy can motivate an adventure.
You should be careful about handing out vis sources in the early sessions of the saga, as a generous supply of vis can lead to fast advancement on the part of the magi. If an isolated vis treasure is too large, you can just refrain from giving any more for a while, but taking a vis source away is more likely to annoy the players.

# Treasures to Hunt
• The raw vis found in the body of the magical wolf that hunts in the hills north of the covenant.
• The raw vis found in the tears of happiness cried by a particular faerie prince.
• A shield created by the wizard who trained the wizard who trained Bonisagus. The shield is said to defend its wielder from all magic, no matter how powerful, but it also has great historical interest.
• The cauldron owned by a powerful faerie, which is said to have the power to raise the dead. • A staff created by a powerful Flambeau magus, said to have the power to create a fire large and hot enough to reduce a city to fine ash.
• A flying castle, crafted by a follower of Verditius over a century ago, but lost after the grogs rebelled against the magi who lived there and threw them over the edge.
• The library of a hermit magus who used to live somewhere near the covenant. 
• A set of scrolls belonging to the Cult of Mercury, detailing some of the Cult's most powerful rituals.
• An Arcane Connection to the dragon that lives in the mountains, so that the magi can use sympathetic magic to overcome its Magic Resistance.
