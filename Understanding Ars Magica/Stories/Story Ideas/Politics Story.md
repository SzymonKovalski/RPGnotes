he Order of Hermes has extensive politics, and the mundane elites of particular areas also have political concerns. Negotiation, trade, and court cases all fall under this general heading. Political adventures tend to involve little combat, and normally cannot be solved by the simple application of magic, which makes them good for more powerful magi. It also makes them a good place for companions to shine, particularly mundane politics, where The Gift is a serious hindrance to the magi.

# Political Issues
• A Hermetic Tribunal is coming up, and the other covenants are looking for allies. Of course, choosing to work with one makes enemies of another.
• One of the player magi is framed for a serious Hermetic crime.
• One of the player magi is caught in a serious Hermetic crime.
• The covenant tries to build good relations with a local mundane notable, such as a lord, bishop, or abbot.
• A mundane enemy of the covenant tries to take an important piece of land, possibly containing a vis source, off them through legal processes.
• War threatens to break out in the region around the covenant. While the magi could stay neutral and, most likely, survive, it would not be good for the covenant. Can they broker a peace?
• The local bishop begins preaching vigorously against heresy, and priests are instructed to enquire closely into people’s activities. Many people resent this, but no one dares speak out publicly for fear of being branded a heretic.
• The player character magi disagree strongly over the best course of action to take, and spend the entire session arguing about it.
