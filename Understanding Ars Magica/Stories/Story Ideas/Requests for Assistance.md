In many fantasy stories, heroes or oppressed villagers travel to the wizard’s tower, looking for assistance. In Ars Magica, the player characters are the ones who get asked for help. You could run an interesting story in which the players take the roles of people seeking help from the covenant, and those characters could join the covenant as grogs after their success, but more normally these stories would involve the magi responding to requests
