Some emergency faces the covenant. The advantage of this sort of story is that the characters will try to solve it. The problem is that the consequences of failure can be serious, so you have to give some thought to what will happen if the characters don’t succeed. In general, the reward for success in such adventures is simply that things do not get any worse. Thus, you should avoid relying on them too heavily; give the players a chance to get positive rewards for their heroism.

# Potential Crises
• A monster attacks the covenant.
• A magus from another covenant starts a campaign of harassment against the covenant, being careful to avoid blatantly violating the Code. He might attack grogs, or blight crops, but he will not scry on the covenant, nor attack a magus without declaring Wizard’s War.
• A bishop hears that the covenant is full of heretics, and sets out, with a small army, to investigate.
• A local lord demands that the covenant swear fealty to him, or face the consequences. Swearing is against the Code, but so is getting into a war with the nobility.
• A powerful faerie decides to use the covenant as part of his latest game.
• The covenant’s magical aura suddenly strengthens, and the magi find themselves sharing space with a group of annoyed, arrogant, and powerful spirits. 
• The covenant disappears into a region, and the magi cannot immediately find the way out. (Or in, for those who were away at the time.)
• The grogs rebel against the tyrannical rule of the magi. The players are likely to be playing both sides of this dispute, which could be tricky, but very effective for experienced players
