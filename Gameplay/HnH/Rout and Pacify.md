 Added 2 basic activities for intimidation and diplomacy. Both allowing the players to potentially make wounded enemies flee from combat.

:AA: Rout (auditory, concentrate, emotion, fear, incapacitation, mental, secret)

:AA: Pacify (auditory, concentrate, emotion, linguistic, mental, secret)
Prerequisite: Expert in diplomacy.

both actions make the target fleeing for a minute on a success if they have less than half their HP, or ignore the hp requirement on a critical success. On a critical failure it grants the targets temporary hp equal to their level (min 1)
