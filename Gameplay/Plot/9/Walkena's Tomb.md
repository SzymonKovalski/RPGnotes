#plot 
The forest surrounding the tomb has a single word written in Aklo etched over and over into every rock, piece of bark and even leaf. The word is unusually difficult to decipher, as if the word itself did not want to be read. The tomb itself is no better on the outside, but inside appears clearly lived in, containing stockpiles of supplies and writing utensils.
The tomb is now occupied by [[Whisper the Severed]] whose complete obsession about their god causes them to experience a compulsion to write its name over and over, but always ending up writing the name of the usurper who severed them. Due to their condition communication may be difficult.

They give the players the [[Chewtoy Doll]] and directs them to the Eye of Abendego

The players can try to persuade Rune to go with them or allow her to pursue revenge in Mzali.
	Let her stay - Skip to [[Travel the Jungle 2]] and [[Death of Walkena|Rune Kills Walkena]]
	If they choose to help them - [[Assasinate Walkena (Optional)]]
	Take her with you - Skip to [[Travel the Jungle 2]] and travel pace is slowed
