The players meet some [[Magaambia]]n Delegates on a diplomatic mission to [[Mzali]]. Rune insists on joining them due to her personal goals
```
The jungle gives way to the skyline of massive temples towering over stone walls
that surround Mzali. The temples are each topped with impressive spires, statues,
and other architectural marvels. Beyond the thick gates, the city is bustling. The sun beats down on Mzali, causing the sandstone buildings to shine and glow with an almost golden light. Dozens of people, each wearing heavy jewelry and spotless outfits, walk around with smiles on their faces. Some of the smiles hold genuine joy, while others seem forced or even full of fear. Though smiles abound, the sounds of the people are less than lively. Murmurs and monotone conversations hum about the air, and there is little in the way of laughter. Smiles fade for just a moment as people catch sight of travelers from a distant land, but they return just as quickly as the people move about their day.

As the Magaambyans approach the gates, a group of guards arrives and demands to know the delegation’s purpose for entering. Ahassunu is quick to provide documentation stamped with a golden seal. After a bit of careful scrutiny, a guard nods and leads the delegation through the city. The group doesn’t have to travel far as the guard leads them to the Golden
Mouse, an inn only a few blocks from the city’s south gate. An old, bearded man with a large build steps out to welcome the foreigners. They are directed to the Golden Mouse where they can stay, but are ambushed by guards to test if the delegates are strong enough for the sun gods notice.
