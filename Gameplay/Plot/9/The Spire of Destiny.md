#plot
A natural wonder is destroyed and out comes [[Rune, Forsaken Child]]. If the players brought [[Zedzaa, Planar Researcher.]] he dies in the crash and his blood feeds rune enough that they dont jump the players out of hunger. If they only brought [[Eva Lovelorn, the Medusa Blacksmith]] she dies instead.
Rune convinces the players that they should help her reach Mzali, a city ruled by an evil tyrant.
